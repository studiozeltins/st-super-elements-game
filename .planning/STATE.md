# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-06)

**Core value:** A retained PVPvE loop — chase endless Transcendence power (scarce shards past
C6), contest it via PVP theft + co-op raids, with no progress-wipe churn (C0–C6 is a protected
floor).
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — transcendence-install

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (transcendence-install) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-06 — Phase 02 execution resumed (wave continue)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11% (1 of 9 phases complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Naming]: Two-tier `gems` / `transcendShards` economy with a verbatim identifier contract (LOCKED).
- [Phase A]: Wipe (not migrate) accepted for the primogems→gems rename; all later phases are additive schema.
- [Death]: PVE-death shard = ground collectible; PVP-death shard = stolen by killer.
- [Tunables]: `MAX_TRANSCEND_LEVEL=10`, `TRANSCEND_DAMAGE_STEP=0.05`, `RAID_SHARD_PAYOUT=6`, etc. finalized in Phase 0.
- [Phase 01]: resolveDupeGrant extracted as a pure dependency-free helper so the C6-overflow mint semantics are unit-testable via cross-import before any reducer wiring.
- [Phase ?]: transcendShards wired: C6-overflow dupe mints 1 shard via resolveDupeGrant, gems unchanged; DUPLICATE_REFUND removed
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01]: transcendShards deployed to LOCAL via additive migrate; .default(0) required to backfill existing rows without a wipe; bindings regenerated so player.transcendShards is typed
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 02]: resolveTranscendInstall + transcendDamageMultiplier extracted as pure dependency-free helpers, test-first, before any reducer/game-loop wiring
- [Phase 02]: transcendCharacter reducer is the sole server-side enforcement point for the shard currency (C6/cap/cost/ownership); owned_character.transcendLevel added as additive .default(0) column; healParty scales by healer transcendLevel
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 02]: transcend module published additively to LOCAL (transcend_level column, no wipe; player=1/owned_character=8 intact); bindings regenerated so transcendLevel + transcendCharacter client-typed. maincloud deferred (paused DB, no recovery-wipe).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [01-04 GATE] Blocking human-verify playtest pending: confirm ◈ chip on all Gacha tabs + Character topbar, and that a C6-dupe mints exactly 1 shard with gems unchanged (see 01-04-SUMMARY.md "Human Verification Pending").
- All work must land on `feat/transcendence` (off `master`, not `main`).
- pnpm only; server module path is `./spacetimedb` (the `spacetime:publish` npm scripts point at the wrong `server` path — ignore them).
- Every data change must keep client/server mirrors in sync (`serverSync.test.ts`) — INV-5.
